# 🔍 Analysis Performed  

### 1️⃣ Data Cleaning & Preparation  
- Converted `TotalCharges` to numeric format  
- Handled missing values  
- Created tenure-based cohorts  

---

### 2️⃣ Overall Churn Rate Analysis  
- Calculated total percentage of customers who churned  
- Evaluated the scale of the retention problem  

---

### 3️⃣ Churn by Contract Type  
- Compared churn across:
  - Month-to-month  
  - One-year contracts  
  - Two-year contracts  

---

### 4️⃣ Churn by Service & Payment Method  
- Analyzed churn patterns based on:
  - Internet service type  
  - Payment method  

---

### 5️⃣ Tenure-Based Cohort Analysis  
Customers were grouped into tenure cohorts:
- 0–6 months  
- 7–12 months  
- 13–24 months  
- 25+ months  

Churn rates were analyzed across these lifetime stages to understand early vs long-term retention behavior.

---

### 6️⃣ Customer Lifetime Patterns  
- Compared tenure distribution between churned and retained customers  
- Identified high-risk early-stage churn  

---

# 📈 Key Insights  

- The overall churn rate is approximately **27%**, indicating a significant retention challenge.
- Customers on **month-to-month contracts** exhibit substantially higher churn compared to long-term contract customers.
- Churn is highest among customers in their **first six months**, highlighting onboarding and early engagement as critical retention phases.
- Certain service types and payment methods are associated with elevated churn rates.
- Long-term customers demonstrate significantly stronger retention behavior.

---

# 💡 Business Recommendations  

Based on the analysis, the following actions are recommended:

### ✅ Strengthen Early Onboarding  
Focus on customer engagement during the first 3–6 months to reduce early churn.

### ✅ Promote Long-Term Contracts  
Encourage customers to switch from month-to-month plans to long-term contracts through loyalty discounts or bundled incentives.

### ✅ Target High-Risk Segments  
Develop personalized retention strategies for customer segments exhibiting higher churn behavior.

### ✅ Optimize Pricing & Service Experience  
Review pricing structures and perceived service value for high-risk customers to improve retention.

# 🚀 Business Impact  

Customer retention directly impacts revenue growth in subscription-based businesses.  
Reducing churn even marginally can significantly increase long-term profitability and customer lifetime value (CLV).

This project demonstrates how data-driven insights can support strategic decision-making in SaaS and telecom businesses.
